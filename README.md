## Tutorial on how to build a temperature and humidity sensor

  - **Project name:** Climatebot.net
    
  - **My name and LNU credentials:** Oscar Ekberg, oe222ia
    
  - Climatebot.net is a fullstack web service which offers data upon the current temperature (Celsius) and humidity (%) in my home office. The data is visualized by three line graphs. Temperature and humidity has        its own separate chart where the 5 latest measures are displayed. The third chart shows an overview of all historically collected data, where temperature and humidity levels are displayed by a separate graph.        All data is transmitted, stored and rendered through a self-hosted backend running on Amazon Web Services.
  
  - **Estimation of time spent:** ~50 hours

### Objective

  - **Why i chose to do this particular project:** While brainstorming different ideas for this project I was determined to solve an existing problem, e.g. by giving valuable insights upon an existing problem.             Recently I have been experiencing a great increase in discomfort related to indoor climate in my apartment. Hence I came up with the idea of measuring the live temperature and humidity in my home office. The         idea was to provide visualization of potential trends of the indoor climate. Furthermore the visualized data could be used to determine potential causal relationships, e.g. having the fan or PC running.
 
  - **What purpose does Climatebot.net serve:** The web service offers valuable data which can be analyzed and utilized in order to increase the level of comfort in my home office.
  
  - **What insights will this project give:** As discussed the web service will be utilized as a tool in order to increase the indoor level of comfort. Furthermore several personal insights will be achieved, e.g. I       will plan and build an entire web service from scratch to deployment. Hence I will be practicing and refining my fullstack development skills. This includes:
      **- Frontend (HTML, CSS, JS)**
      **- Backend (Pyhon Flask, MySQL)**
      **- Server configuration and management (AWS)**
      **- Code management (Git, Bash-scripts for automation)**
      **- And of course the start of the show, building an IOT device.**
